## Test-Driven Development for Gradle

The continuous-mode (-t) of Gradle allows to immediately rerun test on each code-change.
Unfortunately, it just appends to the terminal and thus it is sometimes hard for the brain to immediately find the output of the current test-run.

This plugin for Gradle clears the screen before each run of the continuous-mode-build.
